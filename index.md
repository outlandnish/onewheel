# OneWheel technical info

## Disclaimer

I'm just trying to aggregate bits of technical details I was able to find published on the internet. (See the credits section.) This is in no way a tutorial to do anything. I'm not responsible for any damage you cause by using this info. Even though I do my best to verify and double-check I'm not guaranteeing the correctness of the information aggregated in this repo.
