# What to expect

I was not able to find much of detailed info about OneWheel internals. My aim is to make this site a "go-to" resource for anyone trying to understand and/or fix their OneWheel by aggregating bits of details I was able to scour the internet for or research myself. (See Credits.)

I'm a fan of open source and open hardware. The Right to Repair is very relevant in this context.
